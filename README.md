# it-254-project

DESCRIPTION: My group's IT 254 project is a secure, face-unlocked door. It is to work as follows; through Google's teachable machines, we teach the machine to recognize each group members faces. For this project, only the members faces are recorded. However, an "other" option is included for when the machine recognizes something other than a member's face. Using this trained machine, the data is exported as a tensorflow file and imported into VS code where it can then be used to operate an Arduino kit, where a door will open or closed if the webcam recognizes a member's face. 

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Upload .ino file code to Arduino. 
2. Open the .py file in VS studio, and reference the keras file.
3. Run code!
